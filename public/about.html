    <h2>The Project:</h2>
    <p>
	This project is a wiki page that allows a user to search for movies and people and edit selected information about them. It uses NodeJS' Express module to send and receive requests and Sqlite3 module to interact with a database of movie information.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project also uses the jQuery and AngularJS frameworks to facilitate the multitude of innerHTML/replace functions that load unique pages for each movie or person.
